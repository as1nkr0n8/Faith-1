Entry for DotSlash Hackathon
Team : Faith+1(Github somehow changed + to -)

This Project is made for DotSlash Hackathon 2018

Main Idea behind this was to implement online voting system for managing the hostel's mess menu every week.

This website has login for both Hostelites and Mess Manager, and accordingly various features are added.

For DB, we've used XAMPP and MySQL, sql file is already provided.

Thanks for noticing this!!
